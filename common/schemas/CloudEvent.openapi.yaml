  description: |
    CloudEvent is a specification for describing event data in a common way.

    CloudEvents seeks to dramatically simplify event declaration and delivery
    across services, platforms, and beyond.

    CloudEvents has received a large amount of industry interest,
    ranging from major cloud providers to popular SaaS companies.

    CloudEvents is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF)
    and was approved as a Cloud Native sandbox level project on May 15, 2018
    and as an incubator project on Oct 24, 2019.
